# High Speed Novel View Synthesis via Unsynchronized Videos

**Timeline :** 2021 Oct - 2022 Feb

We conducted research focused on synthesizing novel views using unsynchronized video data.
The project involved creating 3D content with Blender and
training a deep learning model capable of generating novel perspectives
across spatial and temporal deformations.
This approach enabled the efficient production of high-speed view synthesis,
showcasing the potential for advanced applications in video processing and AI.
