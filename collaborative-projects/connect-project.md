The project aims to prevent the malicious use of small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)
by developing a multimodal localization system that incorporates sound,
passive radio frequency (RF), and optical sensors.
As part of this project, I developed a testbed to collect data.
My work also involved developing a machine learning-based UAV detection model
to improve localization and identification of potential threats.
