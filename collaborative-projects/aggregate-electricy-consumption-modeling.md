As part of the undergraduate senior project,
we proposed an enhanced model for analyzing electricity consumption,
focusing on hybrid customer models.
The project involved developing dynamic pricing models for smart grids,
incorporating enriched customer behavior types to optimize energy usage and pricing strategies.
This approach aimed to improve efficiency and offer more tailored pricing solutions based on real-time data and customer usage patterns.
