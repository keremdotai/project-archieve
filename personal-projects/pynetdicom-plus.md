# Extension on Python Implementation of DICOM Networking Protocols

**Timeline :** 2024 Feb

Building on the Pynetdicom library,
I extended its functionality by adding support for asynchronous operations and multiprocessing.
This enhancement allows developers to handle DICOM networking tasks more efficiently,
particularly in environments requiring high concurrency.
Additionally, I implemented features that improved the handling of requested and accepted contexts,
ensuring greater flexibility and reliability in DICOM communications.
