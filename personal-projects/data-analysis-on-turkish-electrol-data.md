# Data Analysis on Turkish Electoral Data

**Timeline :** 2023 May - 2024 Mar

I developed a comprehensive dataset by scraping Turkish electoral data
and processing it into an easy-to-use format for further analysis.
This project involved cleaning and organizing the data
to facilitate insightful analysis of electoral trends and results.
The processed data enabled in-depth analyses,
and the conclusions were provided to corresponding institutions for further use in decision-making and research.
